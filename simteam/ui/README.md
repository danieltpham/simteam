## Overview

A full-stack interactive platform that demonstrates **end-to-end data science, machine learning, and modern backend engineering** in a real-world setting.

* üß† **A simulation engine** modelling workforce dynamics (hiring, promotion, attrition)
* üóÇ **A live database backend** with a fully normalised schema and API access
* ü§ñ **An LLM-powered AI assistant** that translates natural language into executable SQL
* üìà **A machine learning meta-model** that predicts simulation outcomes using AutoML
* üíª **A clean interactive frontend** built with Streamlit + custom React components

This project shows how to move from **code-based modelling and simulation** to a **production-style AI & analytics tool**, complete with cloud deployment, custom UI, and API interfaces.

## üß≠ Features in the Interface

* **ORG CHART**: Explore the company structure at any date; sidebar shows that day‚Äôs event stream.
* **AI CHATBOT**: Ask org-related questions in plain English (e.g. ‚ÄúWho was promoted last week?‚Äù).
* **META MODEL**: Run a full simulation and see how well a predictive model matches the outcome.

---

## üí° Tips for Use

* Use the sidebar to select a date and observe personnel events.
* Hover `‚ÑπÔ∏è` icons throughout the interface for help.
* Use the chatbot to query your organisation.
* Run "what-if" experiments using the meta model.
