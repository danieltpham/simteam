### Meta Model

This section lets you simulate future organisational changes and predict their impact using a machine learning meta-model.

Steps:
1. **Adjust simulation weights** to prioritise different event types (hire, promote, leave).
2. **Set constraints** such as minimum employees before departures can occur.
3. Click **Run Simulation & Predict** to simulate events and compare actual vs predicted outcomes.

Outputs:
- **Time Series Plot**: Number of total employees over time.
- **Summary Table**: Simulated vs predicted key stats.

Use this to explore "what-if" scenarios and validate the meta-model's ability to replicate realistic dynamics.
